## Overview

![screenshot](./Screen%20Shot%202022-08-23%20at%2018.18.19-fullpage.png)

- The above is a screenshot of my solution to the challenge. - The challenge was to fulfil the user stories below:

1. I can see a page following the given design
2. I can see a page on mobile following the given design.
3. I can go to certain locations by selecting links in the navigation or footer.
4. Surprise creator with mobile navigation.

- I further improved my ability to pay attention-to-details, as I replicated the design provided.
- I made use of the BEM methodology for css classes. This was my first time of using it in a personal project after discovering it, and this was very good practice. I'll use it even more in further projects.
- What was your experience?
